when adding in sizes and quantities...If one of them are blank I want it to not show up in google sheets and not to show up on the pdf

Remove will work as intended but need to delete in order cant remove someone from the middle

partial payment needs to be added to the PDF

find fonts for the PDF?

split functions into diff files. Will make it easier to read/maintain
